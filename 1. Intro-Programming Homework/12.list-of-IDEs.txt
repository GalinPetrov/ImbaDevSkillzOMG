Eclipse
The interface is a lot cleaner and concise than Visual Studio and the languages that are possible to use extend past the
.Net Framework. Besides being the number on way to develop Android applications via the Android SDK, it is fully 
extensible to use languages such as Ruby, C, C++ and many many more. Among its most destinctive and defining traits 
are: language accessability, its free-to-use status, its integrated code compiler and its steep learning curve

Netbeans
Netbeans is the number one alternative to Eclipse. This program is extensible and free, and it compiles code which is
 a bonus. When installing Netbeans it comes with a Java server called GlassFish that you could deploy on your 
computer for your testing environment. This server is the second biggest server for Java next to WebSphere (which 
is a whole different ball game). It is also free, extensible, includes a code compiler but on the cos side can prove to be 
bloated 

Kate
Kate is a text editor. Not to be looked down upon as it does a lot more than a regular text edit can do and that is what 
makes this an indispensable product. It runs under Linux and features a destinct code folding. On the downside it does 
not compile code and suffers from an KDE overhead (250mb. just to start the application)

Gedit
gedit is the official editor of the gnome desktop and comes installed once the system is setup. Very useful for the user
that is casually editing code and not undertaking major projects. This would be a good companion to Netbeans or Eclipse.
It too uses Linux and comes readilly installed on gnome systems. It features code highlighting for an "on-the-go" 
debugging. It also allows multiple source packages open at once to jump back and forth between if need be. It major con 
is the inability to compile code

Vim
Vim (an acronym for Vi IMproved) is a text editor written by Bram Moolenaar and first released publicly in 1991. Based 
on the vi editor common to Unix-like systems, Vim is designed for use both from a command line interface and as a 
standalone application in a graphical user interface. Vim is free and open source software and is released under a
 license that includes some charityware clauses, encouraging users who enjoy the software to consider donating to 
children in Uganda. The license is compatible with the GNU General Public License.

Notepad++
This is a versatile and powerful source code editor that also serves as an excellent replacement for the default Notepad
 text editor in Windows. Notepad++ is lightweight, free and is positioned primarily as a source code editor. It upgrades 
over the built-indefault "notepad" by adding features traditional for the "major" software in the field such as line 
numbering, zooming capabilities, detection of modigied files, syntax highlighting and others.
